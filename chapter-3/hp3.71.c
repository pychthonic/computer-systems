/*
 *
 * Write a function good_echo that reads a line from standard input and writes it to
 * standard output. Your implementation should work for an input line of arbitrary length.
 * You may use hte library function fgets, but you must make sure your function works
 * correctly even when the input line requires more space than you have allocated for your
 * buffer. Your code should also check for error conditions and return when one is
 * encountered. Refer to the definitions of the standard I/O functions for documentation
 * [45, 61].
